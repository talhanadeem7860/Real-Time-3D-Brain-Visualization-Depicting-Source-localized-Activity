# Real-Time-3D-Brain-Visualization-Depicting-Source-localized-Activity
A real-time 3D brain imaging system was developed using EEG signals. The system employed LORETA and Dipole Fitting for source localization to visualize brain activity. Real-time processing was achieved by integrating Open VIBE and addressing challenges like artifact removal and signal accuracy.
